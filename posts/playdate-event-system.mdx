## Intro

## The Panic Playdate

The playdate is a little yellow device that has a crank. The screen is 1-bit (black or white with no greys) and the limited internet access and processing power mean the games that are built for it are generally small and cute.

The most popular way to develop for the playdate is using the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/) and Lua, which I did for a recent [game jam game](https://boldbigflank.itch.io/one-man-threat-ops). 

## The Problem

The various components of my game need to respond to changes, but I don't want to wire every possible combination to another, since any added features would have a heavy refactoring cost. As an example, here's a couple cases where classes need to know the state of other classes:

* The UI needs to know when a player's health changes or the timer increments
* The game needs to know when mission objectives are completed, such as enemies dying or the player reaches a teleporter

## The Solution

I made a singleton class that could save and recall functions tied to explicit channels.

```lua:scripts/events.lua

local pd <const> = playdate
local gfx <const> = playdate.graphics

class('Events').extends()

function Events:init()
    self.callbacks = {}
end

-- Select an event string to listen
-- Then the callback function that should execute
function Events:on(event, callback)
    self.callbacks[event] = self.callbacks[event] or {}
    self.callbacks[event][#self.callbacks[event]+1] = callback
end

-- Cleanup functions that won't be used any more
function Events:off(event, callback)
    table.remove(self.callbacks[event], i)
    for i, e in ipairs(self.callbacks[event]) do
        if e == callback then
            table.remove(self.callbacks[event], i)
            break
        end
    end
end

-- Trigger an event
function Events:emit(event, ...) -- the second parameter allows you to include any number of parameters when calling this function
    local fns = table.shallowcopy(self.callbacks[event]) -- just in case the array changes while we are iterating
    for i = 1,#fns do
        fns[i](...)
    end
end

-- Make the import an instance of itself
Events = Events()
```

Then I imported this in `main.lua`, the entry point for Playdate games
```lua:main.lua
-- ... the rest of the imports
import "scripts/events"
-- ... shorthand aliases, constants ...
-- ... pd.update() function
```

With this simple setup, any other classes in the game will have access to `Events`, no need to import anywhere else.

## Uses

### Keep track of mission objectives
My Game Manager will need to know when every enemy on the level dies, or when the player reached a teleporter.
```lua:scripts/gameManager.lua
class('GameSceneUI').extends(gfx.sprite)
function GameManager:init()
    Events:on('enemy_killed', function()
        self.enemyCount -= 1 
        self:checkWinConditions()
    end)
    Events:on('teleporter_reached', function()
        self:checkWinConditions()
    end)
end

-- ... the checkWinConditions() function
```
Then a barrel, enemy or player can emit those events
```ts:scripts/enemy.lua
-- ...
function Enemy:update()
    if (self.health == 0) then
        Events:emit('enemy_destroyed')
        -- remove self
    end
end
```
```ts:scripts/player.lua
-- ...
function Player:update()
    if (--[[ player collides with teleporter --]]) then
        Events:emit('teleporter_reached')
        -- remove self
    end
end
```

### Including Extra Information

We can also send parameters along with the emit event. This is incredibly useful when you want to know the new value of a variable, such as the player's current health or the amount of time left on a timer.

First, the class responsible for drawing the player's health listens:

```lua:scripts/gameSceneUI.lua
class('GameSceneUI').extends(gfx.sprite)
function GameSceneUI:init()
    -- ... other init stuff
    Events:on('health_updated', function (health) self:updateHealth(health) end)
end
-- ... the updateHealth(amount) function
```

And then events are emitted like so:
```lua:scripts/player.lua
function Player:takeDamage(amount)
    self.health = math.max(0, self.health - amount)
    Events:emit('health_updated', self.health)
    if self.health == 0 then
        -- death logic
    end
end
```

This way we don't need to assign a variable and poll it every update to know when the value changes.

## More Useful Features
* Multiple classes can listen for the same events. Not only would the game manager be interested when `enemy_killed` is emitted, other enemies could also listen and become inquisitive or enraged.
* Expanding features later will have very little cost. For example, to create an Achievements system you can hook into existing events (like `enemies_killed`) without changing any other classes.

## Conclusion

The Event system is a clean way to share information in a structured way.
