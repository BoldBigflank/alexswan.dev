Here's my first idea for a [Playdate Pulp](https://play.date/pulp) game. It takes inspiration from [Beast (1984)](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Beast_1984) and [Rodent's Revenge](https://archive.org/details/rodents_revenge).

You play a diamond against a room full of monsters. You can move orthogonally, and the monsters can move diagonally. Don't let the monsters get to you. You can defeat monsters by squishing them between walls.

Higher levels have smarter, faster monsters and fewer blocks to hide behind.
